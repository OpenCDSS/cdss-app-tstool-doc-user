# TSTool / Training / Overview #

This section of the documentation provides information about training lessons for TSTool.

Because learning how to use TSTool is a hands-on exercise,
self-paced training is provided via presentations in the `doc/training` folder under the software installation,
for example in `C:\CDSS\TSTool-14.0.4\doc\training` on Windows.
Training lessons are listed in an order that is recommended for learning TSTool topics.
Training consists of the following resources:

*   presentations as PDF documents
*   working examples that can be open and run in TSTool
*   online videos that expand on the PDF documents (see the [CDSS TSTool product page](https://opencdss.state.co.us/opencdss/tstool/))

Additional training materials will be added over time.
Workshops, webinars, and other training opportunities may also be available.
