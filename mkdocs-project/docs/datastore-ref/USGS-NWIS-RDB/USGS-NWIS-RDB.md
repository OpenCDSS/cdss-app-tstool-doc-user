## Overview ##

The UsgsNwisRdb time series input type corresponds to the
United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS) RDB format.
A number of RDB variations are available but currently only the surface
water daily format is supported.  Data files can be created by saving USGS NWIS
website data to a text file or use the TSTool [`WebGet`](../../command-ref/WebGet/WebGet.md) command.
The example below shows the format of a daily surface water file.
Important comments about the file format are:

*   The file is divided into a header section (top) and data section (bottom).
    Comments can occur only at the top and are lines that begin with #.
*   Optional data flags are saved with the data values, if available (e.g., e indicates estimated data).
*   HTML remnants may be present at the end of the file.  These lines are stripped out as the file is processed.

## Standard Time Series Properties ##

The standard time series identifier for USGS NWIS RDB time series is of the form:

```
Location.DataSource.DataType.Interval~UsgsNwisRdb~PathToFile
```

The limited support of this file format assumes the following:

*   The location part of the time series identifier is taken from the second field (`site_no`) in the data records.
*   The data source part of the time series identifier is taken from the first field (`agency_cd`) in the data records.
*   The data type is assigned as Streamflow (interpretation of the verbose `dv_va` field in the header is not implemented).
*   The data interval is assigned as 1Day (interpretation of the verbose `dv_va` field in the header is not implemented).
*   The input type is set to `UsgsNwisRdb` (USGSNWIS was used in the past) indicating the format of input.
*   The input name is set to the absolute or relative path to the file.
*   The units are assigned as `CFS`.
*   The missing data value is assigned to `-999.0` (gaps in data records will result in this value).
*   The description is set to the information after the Sites in this file include: line.
    It is assumed that only one time series per file is used.

## Limitations ##

USGS NWIS RDB files have the following limitations:

*   Currently only the daily surface water format has been tested.  Additional support will be added in the future.
*   Although data flags are read, no standard flag values are enforced
(the software user will need to know the meaning of the flags to use them properly).
