## Overview ##

The DateValue format has been developed to facilitate data management and processing with the TSTool software.
The example below shows the format of the file.  Important comments about the file format are:

*   The file is divided into a header section with time series properties (top) and data section (bottom).
    Comments can occur anywhere in the file and are lines that start with `#`.
*   The default delimiter between property columns and data columns is a space.
    Use the `Delimiter` property to reset the delimiter (e.g., to a tab).
    Adjacent delimiters WILL NOT be merged into one column; consequently,
    do not use extra delimiters (i.e., whitespace) to format output.
*   If not specified, many of the header properties will be set to reasonable
    defaults as data are read by software such as TSTool.
    However, as much information as possible should be specified to allow complete time series handling.
    Header information is displayed by applications like TSTool to allow selection of time series before the data section is read.
*   If multiple irregular interval time series are stored in the file,
    non-overlapping date/times will result in blanks rather than the missing value
    indicator (missing value indicators indicate actual values in the irregular time series;
    “missing” values are allowed to have data flags, whereas “no value” are represented as blanks).  
*   Property names are case-independent.
*   The `TSID`, `Start`, `End`, and `Units` properties are important for basic time series handling.
    +   The interval part of the `TSID` is used to determine how memory should be allocated for data.
    +   The `Start` and `End` values are used to allocate memory for regular interval time series.
        Dates associated with data values are used to allocate memory for irregular interval time series.
    +   For regular interval time series, if data lines between the start and end dates are omitted,
        the unspecified values are set to the missing data value for the time series.
    +   The `Units` indicates data units and is used to determine the precision
        (number of digits after the decimal point) for output.
        The precision determined from units can be overridden in command parameters
        if the precision from units is not acceptable.

# DateValueTS 1.5 file
#
# This is a sample of a typical DateValue minute time series.  An
# example file is as follows and conforms to the following guidelines:
#
# * Comments are lines that start with #.
# * Applications often add a comment section at the top indicating how the
#   file was created
# * Time hours should be in the range 0 to 23 (an hour of 24 will be
#   converted to hour 0 of the next day).
# * If a time is necessary, the date/time may be separated by a space, T, :, or
#   @.  If a space is used, use date and time column headings.
# * If multiple time series are written, header variables are delimited with
#   space or tab characters.  Data are delimited as per the Delimiter property.
# * Time series are required to have the same data interval.
# * Header property values and column headers can be enclosed in double quotes
#   if the data contain spaces.
# * Missing data can either be coded as the missing data value or no value.
# * Missing records will result in missing data being used when read.
#
# The following header variables are recognized.  This information can be
# used by software.

## Standard Time Series Properties ##

The standard time series identifier for DateValue files is as follows:

```
Location.DataSource.DataType.Interval.Scenario~DateValue~PathToFile
```

Because DateValue time series files are a persistent storage format for in-memory time series objects,
the properties stored in the file closely match the standard time series properties of the objects.
In particular, the time series data type, units, and missing data value are consistent with time series header information.
The `TSID` property in a DateValue file is directly applied to time series objects read from the file,
allowing explicit identification of the time series in the file, regardless of the name of the file.
This allows multiple time series to be saved in a single file.
The data source typically agrees with that determined from a data-supplying agency or model that generates the data.

## Limitations ##

DateValue files have the following limitations:

*   The header information in DateValue files may be too technical for some general tools.
    However, simple delimited files require additional information for TSTool
    to properly handle the data as time series with properties.
    Spreadsheets can import DateValue files easily by ignoring the header lines.
*   Because date/time values are included on every data line,
    processing DateValue time series files requires more disk space and processing time.
    However, using the dates on each line also allows gaps in data to be omitted from the file.
    Inclusion of the date/times for each data point is considered a reasonable
    trade-off to ensure data quality and readability.
    Many other time series file formats also include the date/time on each line.

## Format Versions ##

DateValue file format versions have changed as follows:

*   1.6 – add support for time series properties and data flag descriptions.
    String, integer, date, and floating point number properties are supported and in the future other object types may be supported.
*   1.5 – change ensemble trace time series to use string `SequenceID`
    (surround identifiers with double quotes and use blank for missing) rather than previous
    integer SequenceNum (does not surround values with quotes, uses `-1` for missing)
*   1.4 – treat consecutive delimiters as separate data fields
*   1.3 – treated consecutive delimiters as one delimiter

## Examples ##

The following is an example file for day interval data with data flags:

```
# DateValueTS 1.6 file
# Example DateValue file 
#
Delimiter   = " "
NumTS       = 1
TSID        = "MyLoc..MyData.Day"
Alias       = "MyLoc"
Description = "Test data, pattern"
DataType    = "MyData"
Units       = "CFS"
MissingVal  = -999.0000
DataFlags   = true
Start       = 1950-01-01
End         = 1951-03-12
#
# Time series comments/histories:
#
#
# Creation history for time series 1 (TSID=MyLoc..MyData.Day Alias=MyLoc):
#
#   Created new time series with interval determined from TSID "MyLoc..MyData.Day"
#   Set 1950-01-01 to 1951-03-12 to pattern=5.000,10.000,12.000,13.000,75.000,
#                        flags=Flag1,Flag2,,Flag4,Flag5
#
#EndHeader
Date "MyLoc, CFS" DataFlag
1950-01-01 5.0000 "Flag1"
1950-01-02 10.0000 "Flag2"
1950-01-03 12.0000 ""
1950-01-04 13.0000 "Flag4"
1950-01-05 75.0000 "Flag5"
1950-01-06 5.0000 "Flag1"
1950-01-07 10.0000 "Flag2"
1950-01-08 12.0000 ""
1950-01-09 13.0000 "Flag4"
1950-01-10 75.0000 "Flag5"
...
```

The following is an example file for hour interval data (no data flags):

```
# DateValueTS 1.6 file
#
Delimiter   = " "
NumTS       = 1
TSID        = "MyLoc..MyData.Hour"
Alias       = "MyLoc"
Description = "Test data, pattern"
DataType    = "MyData"
Units       = "CFS"
MissingVal  = NaN
Start       = 1950-01-01 00
End         = 1950-01-03 12
#
# Time series comments/histories:
#
#
# Creation history for time series 1 (TSID=MyLoc..MyData.Hour Alias=MyLoc):
#
#   Created new time series with interval determined from TSID "MyLoc..MyData.Hour"
#   Set 1950-01-01 00 to 1950-01-03 12 to pattern=5.000,10.000,12.000,13.000,75.000
#
#EndHeader
Date Time "MyLoc, CFS"
1950-01-01 00 5.0000
1950-01-01 01 10.0000
1950-01-01 02 12.0000
1950-01-01 03 13.0000
1950-01-01 04 75.0000
1950-01-01 05 5.0000
