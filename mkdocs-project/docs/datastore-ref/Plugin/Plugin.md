## Overview ##

TSTool allows plugin datastores, as of version ?
This is an experimental feature to allow datastore integration for third-party data sources,
such as databases and web services that are outside the core State of Colorado TSTool product.
Issues being evaluated:

1. How to isolate plugin runtime software, configuration, and documentation from main code,
while also streamlining integration?
2. How to handle different versions of plugins and manage through the TSTool user interface?
3. How to have standard download site for plugins?

**More information will be added to this section in the future.**

**Need to figure out how plugin datastore documentation will be made accesible when not
part of the core MkDocs documentation.**
