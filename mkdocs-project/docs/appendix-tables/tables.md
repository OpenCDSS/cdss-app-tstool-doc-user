# TSTool / Tables

This documentation provides general information about tables.

## Introduction

Tables in TSTool are implemented as a generic data object that is based on columns and rows,
and can be used to integrate data processing with the following:

* database tables
* binary database files
* Excel worksheets (spreadsheets)
* delimited and fixed-format files
* JSON file object arrays
* time series data (as table)
* spatial data layer attribute table

Tables have the following design features:

* Each column must have a consistent data type,
which allows commands and formatting to be handled consistently.
The table column type can be viewed by right-clicking on the table in the TSTool ***Results*** area
and selecting the ***Table properties*** menu item.
* Tables each have an identifier, which is used to access the table during processing.
* Columns are named and rows have number 1+.
The table column heading that contain the name are not considered to be a part of the table data.
* Missing data depend on the data type and are handled internally as:
	+ `null` (generally)
	+ empty string (for strings)
	+ `NaN` (for floating point values)
* Tables can be read from various formats and output to various formats.
* Table columns have properties including type and, depending on type,
width and output precision (for floating point numbers).

## Condition Evaluation for Rows

Some commands provide a `Condition` parameter to limit which rows will be processed by the command.
For example, see:

* [`DeleteTableRows`](../command-ref/DeleteTableRows/DeleteTableRows.md)
* [`TableMath`](../command-ref/TableMath/TableMath.md)

The `Condition` parameter is restricted to a simple format and comparison and
will be enhanced to support more complex syntax over time:

```
ColumnName operator Value
```

The `ColumnName` matches a table column name.
The operator is described below.
The `Value` is specified as a constant value consistent with the column type and can be specified with
`${Property}` that evaluates to a primitive type.
The data value from the indicated column is compared to `Value`.
Values can have the following type:

* integer
* double (floating point number)
* string

The operator is one of the following.

* `<`
* `<=`
* `>`
* `>=`
* `==` (use this to test equality â€“ do not use a single equal sign)
* `!=`
* `contains` (only for string comparison)
* `!contains` (only for string comparison)
* `isempty` (only for string comparison, and `Value` should not be specified)
* `!isempty` (only for string comparison, and `Value` should not be specified)

Additional criteria for strings include:

* For `<` and `>` comparisons, `A` is less than `Z`, etc. as per the [ASCII table](https://www.asciitable.com/).
* Comparisons are case-specific.  Support for case-independent comparisons may be added in the future.
* Null string is treated as empty string for `isempty` and `!isempty` operators.
