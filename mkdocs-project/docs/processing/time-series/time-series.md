    including using datastores to read and write databases and web services
*   analyzing time series to produce information products
*   creating input for models, including filling missing data
*   performing quality control analyses
*   comparing time series as part of automated testing

The ***Results / Time Series*** tab lists time series that are created when processing commands.
Right-click on a time series to view in various formats.
