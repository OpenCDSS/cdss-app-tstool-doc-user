# CDSS / TSTool #

This documentation provides resources to learn how to use
[Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS)](https://cdss.colorado.gov/) TSTool software,
which automates processing time series, data tables, and other data.
This documentation is generally referred to as the **"User Documentation"** in contrast to
**"Developer Documentation"**, which is relevant to software developers.

TSTool has been developed by the Open Water Foundation (OWF) with significant
funding provided by the Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB)
in coordination with the Division of Water Resources (DWR),
as part of Coloradoâ€™s Decision Support Systems (CDSS).

Additional enhancement to TSTool have been funded by various organizations including:

* Open Water Foundation
* US Bureau of Reclamation
* Tennessee Valley Authority
* and others

## Colorado's Decision Support Systems ##

Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS, [https://cdss.colorado.gov/](https://cdss.colorado.gov/))
has been developed to answer important questions about Colorado's water resources.
CDSS efforts are led by the [Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB)](http://cwcb.state.co.us)
and [Colorado Division of Water Resources (DWR)](http://water.state.co.us).

CDSS has been under development since 1994, with progress occurring via a series of basin
decision support systems (DSS), starting with the Colorado River DSS (CRDSS).
Other focused DSS were also developed, such as the CWCB's Instream Flow DSS.
Each DSS resulted in enhancements to the core CDSS tools,
which are envisioned as a general platform of data and tools to help with water supply planning.

The TSTool software was originally developed in CDSS to process time series and other data
from Colorado's HydroBase database into into water resources model data files.
Since the initial development, TSTool has been significantly enhanced to use additional data sources,
add commands with new functionality, and add new functionality to facilitate interactive
and automated data processing.

In late 2016, the Open Water Foundation began the effort to move TSTool and other CDSS software to open source licensing
and establish open source software projects, referred to as "OpenCDSS".
The OpenCDSS project is resulting in a significant evolution in how CDSS software development occurs,
such as implementing version control with Git/GitHub and modernizing the development environment and documentation.
See the [OpenCDSS Website](http://opencdss.state.co.us/opencdss/) for more information.

## About the Open Water Foundation ##

The [Open Water Foundation](http://openwaterfoundation.org) is a nonprofit social enterprise that focuses
on developing and supporting open source software for water resources,
so that organizations can make better decisions about water.
OWF also works to advance open data tools and implementation.
OWF staff have been the primary TSTool developers on State of Colorado and other projects.
