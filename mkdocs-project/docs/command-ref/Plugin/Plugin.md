## Overview ##

TSTool allows plugin commands, as of version ?
This is an experimental feature to allow commands integration for third-party commands,
such commands to read and write datastores,
and perform specific processing that is outside the core State of Colorado TSTool product.
Plugin commands are also useful for experimental command that can be developed using
an installed TSTool and development environment only for the plugin.

Issues being evaluated:

1.  How to isolate plugin runtime software, configuration, and documentation from main code,
    while also streamlining integration?
2.  How to handle different versions of plugins and manage through the TSTool user interface?
3.  How to have standard download site for plugins?

**More information will be added to this section in the future.**

**Need to figure out how plugin datastore documentation will be made accesible when not
part of the core MkDocs documentation.**
