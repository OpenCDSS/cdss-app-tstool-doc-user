## Overview ##

The `CompareTimeSeries` command compares time series to determine data differences.
This command is often used to test a process.
Currently time series header information is NOT compared – only data values are compared.
It is designed to process many time series in bulk fashion.
Time series to compare are determined by trying to match each available time series
with another time series in the list (ignoring itself) using one of the following options for input:

* Two lists of time series, for example the same set of time series from two different databases or files.
Typically the location identifiers and possibly data types will be the same in the two lists.
* Compare two time series directly.
* Compare time series from two ensembles.

Time series are compared value by value for each date/time in the analysis period,
with the differences computed as the value
from the second time series minus the value from the first time series.
The values can be rounded based on a specified precision.
If necessary, read each set of time series from files to ensure that final round off is consistent.
The checks occur by comparing the difference to one or more specified tolerances.
Differences and simple statistics are printed to the log file.
Values that are different can optionally be indicated using the following:

* set a character flag, for use with the graphing package
* create a time series of the differences
* generate a command warning if a difference is detected, or if no differences are detected
* create a table record listing the difference, which can viewed or output with other commands

Date/time in time series is handled as follows:

* In order to compare time series, it is important that the date/times for data values align.
Lack of alignment can result in differences.
**There is currently no command feature to accept date/time differences within a tolerance.**
* The precision of the time series should be the same.
For regular-interval time series, the interval base and date/time precision are the same (e.g., 5Min interval
has a precision of minute).
For irregular interval time series the time series interval may be `irregular` and the precision must
be determined from the period date/times.
TSTool is being updated over time to support irregular interval with base (e.g., "irregDay") but this is not universal.
* To help ensure alignment of time series, the following approach is taken:
	+ Regular interval time series:  Are compared as usual because the times should line up.
	+ Irregular interval time series:  If at least one of the two time series are irregular interval,
	the date/times for both time series are added to a sorted list, which is used to retrieve data from
	both time series.  Any date/times that result in only one value will result in a difference.

|---|--------------|-----------------|----------------- |
|2 time series|`TSID1`|First time series identifier (or alias) to compare.|Specify if only 2 time series are compared.|
|2 time series|`TSID2`|Second time series identifier (or alias) to compare.|Specify if only 2 time series are compared.|
|2 ensembles|`EnsembleID1`|First ensemble identifier to compare.|Specify if time series from 2 ensembles are compared.|
|2 ensembles|`EnsembleID2`|Second ensemble identifier to compare.|Specify if time series from 2 ensembles are compared.|
||`MatchLocation`|Match the location part of time series identifiers when matching time series to compare.|`True`|
||`MatchDataType`|Match the data type part of time series identifiers when matching time series to compare.|`False`|
||`Precision`|When comparing data values, round the values to the given precision.  For example, a precision of 2 will round to the hundredths place.  This can be used to do comparisons on the lowest precision of the available time series.|Compare the available values without rounding.|
||`Tolerance`|Specify a comma-separated list of values.  The difference in the time series values will be compared to the tolerances and messages printed to the log file.|A tolerance of zero will be used to detect differences.|
||`CompareFlags`|Indicate whether data flags should be compared, `False` or `True`. | `False`|
||`AnalysisStart`|The starting date/time to analyze for differences.  Specify a date/time of appropriate precision for the time series or `OutputStart` to use the output start.|Analyze all available data.|
||`AnalysisEnd`|The ending date/time to analyze for differences.  Specify a date/time of appropriate precision for the time series or `OutputEnd` to use the output end.|Analyze all available data.|
||`DiffFlag`|Specify as a single character to append a flag to the data flags for the time series.  Each value that is different is flagged in both time series that are compared.  The flag can be displayed by the graphing package.  This is useful for verification processes.  New time series will be created with the original identifier preceded by `Diff_`.|Do not flag data.|
||`WarnIfDifferent`|If `True` and at least one difference is detected, a warning will be generated by the command, which will result in software like TSTool displaying a warning.  If `False`, only status messages are written to the log file.  The warning is useful if it is critical to detect any change in the time series.|Do not generate a warning if time series are different.  Differences are printed to the log file.|
||`WarnIfSame`|If `True` and no differences are detected, a warning will be generated by the command, which will result in software like TSTool displaying a warning.  If `False`, only status messages are written to the log file.  The warning is useful if it is critical to detect that time series are the same.|Do not generate a warning if time series are the same.|
||`CreateDiffTS`|Indicate whether a time series should be created containing the differences between time series (TS2 – TS1).  This is useful to visually evaluate the differences and process the results with other commands.|`False`|
||`TableID`| Table identifier for table to create listing differences.| No output table will be created. |
||`DiffCountProperty`| Name of processor property to set with count of timesteps with differences.| No property will be set.|

## Examples ##

* See the [automated tests](https://github.com/OpenCDSS/cdss-app-tstool-test/tree/master/test/commands/CompareTimeSeries).

The following example illustrates how time series from two files can be compared.
For example, use similar commands to compare results from two model runs or two database queries:

```
# Example to compare files.  Since they are different, a warning will be generated.
ReadDateValue(InputFile="RawData1.dv")
ReadDateValue(InputFile="RawData1Scaled.dv")
CompareTimeSeries(Precision=2,WarnIfDifferent=True)
```

The following example compares matching time series for the full available period, doing checks for several tolerances:

```
CompareTimeSeries(Precision=2,Tolerance="0,.1,.5,1",DiffFlag="x")
```

The following example compares data only within the output period, as specified by the [`SetOutputPeriod`](../SetOutputPeriod/SetOutputPeriod.md) command:

```
CompareTimeSeries(Precision=2,Tolerance="0,.1,.5,1",
AnalysisStart="OutputStart",AnalysisEnd="OutputEnd",DiffFlag="x")
```
